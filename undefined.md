# Foam

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to your new Foam Workspace!

## Getting started

This documentation assumes that you have a GitHub account and have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on your Linux/MacOS/Windows machine.

1. If you haven't yet, browse over to the main [Foam documentation workspace](https://foambubble.github.io/foam) to get an idea of what Foam is and how to use it.
2. Press "Use this template" button at [foam-template](https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/generate) \(that's this repository!\) to fork it to your own GitHub account. If you want to keep your thoughts to yourself, remember to set the repository private.
3. [Clone the repository to your local machine](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and open it in VS Code.

   _Open the repository as a folder using the `File > Open...` menu item. In VS Code, "open workspace" refers to_ [_multi-root workspaces_](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces)_._

4. When prompted to install recommended extensions, click **Install all** \(or **Show Recommendations** if you want to review and install them one by one\)

After setting up the repository, open [.vscode/settings.json](https://github.com/redboo/knowledge/tree/6c24d88f7c7bf0cdd2f26e620a3f932ba00979b9/.vscode/settings.json) and edit, add or remove any settings you'd like for your Foam workspace.

To learn more about how to use **Foam**, read the [Recipes](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes/recipes) bubbles of the Foam documentation workspace.

## Using Foam

We've created a few Bubbles \(markdown documents\) to get you started.

* \[[inbox](inbox.md)\] - a place to write down quick notes to be categorised later
* \[[foam-tips](foam-tips.md)\] - tips to get the most out of your Foam workspace
* \[[todo](todo.md)\] - a place to keep track of things to do
